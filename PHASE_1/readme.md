Todo CLI Application

A spec-driven, command-line todo application built with Python 3.13+, following clean code principles and a modular project structure. Tasks are stored in memory, and the CLI allows you to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

The project was developed using Spec-Kit Plus and Gemini, following a spec-first workflow: write specifications → generate plan → implement tasks → wire everything together.
